- **Global Market Access**: Start with US, expand to Europe (2025), Middle East (2025), Australia (2026+)
- **First-Mover Advantage**: Enter markets while competitors hesitate due to uncertainty
- **Proven Market Need**: Starting with validated demand for baby clothing/accessories in US diaspora

### Partnership Philosophy - Building Together as Equals

Mela is not a traditional marketplace where brands are just vendors. We're building an export platform together:
- **Your Expertise + Our Platform**: You know your products and Indian market; we know US diaspora and digital marketing

#### The Indian Diaspora Baby Market Opportunity
- **4.5M Indian Americans** seeking cultural connection through authentic products

- **Premium pricing acceptance** - parents willing to pay 2-3x for quality + cultural authenticity

#### Current Brand Pain Points
- **International shipping costs (₹2,000-5,000)** killing profit margins
- **Zero US market awareness** despite having quality products
- **Amazon/Etsy commoditization** - brand stories lost in generic listings
- **Individual US marketing** - too costly and inefficient for most brands
